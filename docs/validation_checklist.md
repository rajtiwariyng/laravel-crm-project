## Validation Against PDF Requirements

This document validates the proposed Laravel solution (documented in `database_design.md`, `eloquent_models.md`, `controllers_routes.md`, `ajax_frontend_custom_fields.md`, `merge_logic.md`) against the requirements specified in `PHPTask.pdf`.

**Requirement Checklist:**

1.  **Framework:** Use **any PHP framework** (Laravel chosen).
    *   **Status:** Met. The solution is designed for Laravel.
2.  **CRUD for "Contacts":**
    *   Implement CRUD operations. - **Met.** Controllers and AJAX routes defined.
    *   Proper database schema. - **Met.** Detailed schema provided.
3.  **Form Fields:**
    *   Standard fields (Name, Email, Phone, Gender, Profile Image, Additional File). - **Met.** Included in `contacts` table schema and `Contact` model.
    *   Custom Fields (Admin manage, extensible storage, dynamic UI). - **Met.** `custom_fields` and `contact_custom_field_values` tables (EAV approach) allow admin management and extensibility. Dynamic form rendering and handling described.
4.  **AJAX Integration:**
    *   Insert, Update, Delete via AJAX. - **Met.** Specified in controller actions and route definitions.
    *   Success/error messages without full page refresh. - **Met.** Described in frontend handling.
5.  **Filtering and Search:**
    *   Filter by Name, Email, Gender via AJAX. - **Met.** AJAX endpoint (`fetchContacts`) and logic described.
    *   (Optional Bonus) Filter by custom fields. - **Met.** Schema supports (`is_filterable` flag) and controller logic outlined.
6.  **Merging Contacts:**
    *   Merge feature initiation. - **Met.** UI trigger and preparation endpoint defined.
    *   Master contact selection (popup/modal). - **Met.** Described in merge preparation step.
    *   Final confirmation. - **Met.** Confirmation modal flow detailed.
    *   Merge Logic (Retain master, add/merge secondary data). - **Met.** Detailed logic provided, including handling standard and custom fields.
    *   Custom Field Merge Policy. - **Met.** Options discussed (keep master, user choice, append).
    *   No data loss (preserve secondary data). - **Met.** Secondary contact marked as 'merged' and linked; optional history snapshot included.
    *   Track merged record. - **Met.** `status` field and `merged_into_contact_id` foreign key.
    *   Clear UI for merged fields/values. - **Met.** Confirmation modal design addresses this.
    *   Technical considerations (EAV/JSON merge). - **Met.** EAV merge logic detailed.
    *   Extensible solution. - **Met.** Design inherently supports adding new custom fields.
7.  **Evaluation Criteria:**
    *   Database Design & Extensibility. - **Addressed.**
    *   Clean Code & Best Practices. - **Addressed** (by outlining standard Laravel practices).
    *   UI/UX. - **Addressed** (through descriptions of AJAX interactions, modals, feedback).
    *   Merging Logic. - **Addressed.**
    *   Testing/Verification. - **Addressed** (solution design enables verification).
8.  **Deliverable:** Record a video. - **Note:** This is an instruction for the implementer, not part of the solution design itself.

**Conclusion:** The documented solution comprehensively addresses all technical requirements outlined in the `PHPTask.pdf`. The design focuses on extensibility, AJAX-driven UI, proper data handling for custom fields, and robust merge logic with data preservation.
